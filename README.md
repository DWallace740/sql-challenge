### Pewlett Hackard Employee Data Analysis

## Project Overview

As part of the Pewlett Hackard Data Engineering Team, this project explores employee data from the 1980s and 1990s. Using structured SQL queries and relational database techniques, the goal was to analyze historical hiring trends, departmental organization, and employee records to provide actionable insights.

### Introduction

This analysis focuses on employee data from Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s. The goal was to understand hiring trends, departmental structures, and employee characteristics through structured SQL queries. The insights from this analysis provide a snapshot of the companyâ€™s workforce during this period and highlight key patterns in hiring and department composition.

This project involved three main stages:

- Data Modeling: Creating a schema based on historical employee data.
- Data Engineering: Populating the database with employee records from CSV files.
- Data Analysis: Using SQL queries to identify trends and extract insights from the data.
